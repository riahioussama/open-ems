#summary Basically, I feel there is a need to create a basic testing software, here are some of my basic ideas so far.
#labels Phase-Design,Featured

* Questions with 4 possible answers*

 * Start page allows you to choose categories or the option to get a cluster of various categories 
 * Have test limits (ie. 25 questions, 50 questions, ect.)
 * Idiot proof
 * Way to report bugs
 * Open as possible
 * First design the application, release the skeleton and then work on a version with questions already built in (this is optional but could help us in the long run)
 * Get more medical professionals to donate questions/answers to us
 * Uniform process for gathering questions/answers in a database friendly way
 * Decide what language to use
